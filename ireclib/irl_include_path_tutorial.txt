/*
  You are getting this error because you have added the ireclib folder to your
  compiler's include search path.  

  You should *NOT* add the ireclib folder itself to your compiler's include path. 
  Doing so will cause the build to fail because of name collisions (such as 
  ireclib/string.h and string.h from the standard library). Instead you should 
  add the folder that contains the ireclib folder to your include search path 
  and then use include statements of the form #include <ireclib/queue.h> or

  XCode:
  	The XCode IDE often puts all folders that it knows about into 
	the compiler search path.  So if you are using XCode then either 
	don't drag the whole ireclib folder into the project or alternatively 
	modify your XCode project settings to not auto-add all folders to 
	the include path.  Instead just make sure that the ireclib folder is 
	itself inside a folder in your include path.
